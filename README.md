# Image Convolution Using C and OpenCV

Learning image convolution, convolution has so many benefits<br>
Such as for lane and sign detection for autopilot car, medical imaging, etc.<br>
In this repository i am doing convolution so that i can make image more bright, more saturated.<br>
I also using Gaussian blur filter and Sobel filter for detecting edges. <br>
The convolutions are built with C Language but i plot using Matplotlib.
